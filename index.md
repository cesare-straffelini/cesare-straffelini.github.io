I am a PhD student in Set Theory at the Universities of Trento and Barcelona, under the supervision of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Bagaria">Joan Bagaria i Pigrau</a>. The topic of my PhD research is Generic Absoluteness: which sentences are preserved by generic extensions of the universe?

Previously, I have obtained a Bachelor's degree and a Master's degree in Mathematics at the <a href="https://www.unitn.it/it">University of Trento</a>. My Bachelor's degree supervisor was professor <a href="https://webapps.unitn.it/du/it/Persona/PER0003680/Curriculum">Stefano Baratella</a>, while my Master's degree supervisor was professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Bagaria">Joan Bagaria i Pigrau</a>.

Both theses were on the topic of the Axiom of Determinacy, with two different approaches: in my Bachelor's thesis I studied the consequences of AD on the reals, while in my Master's thesis I studied the proofs of consistency of AD from large cardinals.

At the UB, I co-organise (together with <a href="https://www.jeffreybergfalk.com/home">Jeffrey Bergfalk</a>) the Marvelous Set Theory Reading Course, an informal reading course where we study set theory together. I also lend a hand when needed for teaching the courses in Basic Set Theory, Combinatorial Set Theory and Models of Set Theory.
