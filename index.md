I am a PhD student in Theoretical Computer Science at <a href="https://www.irif.fr">IRIF</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://samvangool.net">Sam van Gool</a>. My main interest is categorical logic and duality theory: a central objective of my research project is to understand the relationship between ultracategories and polyadic spaces as semantical duals of first-order theories, with applications to topos theory and intuitionistic model theory.
